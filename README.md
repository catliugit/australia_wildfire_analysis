# Analyzing Wildfire Activities in Australia - Coursera Practice Assignment

# Overview
This project analyzes wildfire activities in Australia using various data visualization techniques. It is part of the "Data Visualization with Python" course on Coursera.

# Course Information
- Course Name: [Data Visualization with Python on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-for-data-visualization/home/welcome)
- Instructor: [Dr. Pooja]

# Objectives
Using Matplotlib, Pandas, Seaborn, and Folium to create informative plots and charts
Visualize geographical data using Folium
Analyze trends and patterns in wildfire activities in Australia

# Modifications and Enhancements
- Additional Data Visualizations: Added more comprehensive visualizations to provide deeper insights into the wildfire data.
- Enhanced Data Preprocessing: Improved data cleaning and preprocessing steps to ensure higher accuracy and reliability of the visualizations.
- Interactive Maps with Folium: Created interactive maps to visualize wildfire activities across different regions in Australia.
- Extended Analysis: Conducted further analysis to identify potential causes and patterns of wildfires.

# Steps:
# Download Required Libraries:
- Install seaborn and folium as shown in this [file](https://github.com/catliugit/australia_wildfire_analysis/blob/main/Aus_Wildfire_Install_Requirements.txt)

# Open Jupyter Notebook:
- In VS Code, go to the Extensions view and search for "Jupyter".
- Install the Jupyter extension, then open or create a .ipynb file to start using Jupyter Notebooks.
