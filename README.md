# Analyzing Wildfire Activities in Australia - Coursera Practice Assignment

# Overview
This project analyzes wildfire activities in Australia using various data visualization techniques. It is part of the "Data Visualization with Python" course on Coursera.

# Course Information
- Course Name: [Data Visualization with Python on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-for-data-visualization/home/welcome)
- Instructor: [Dr. Pooja]

# Objectives
Using Matplotlib, Pandas, Seaborn, and Folium to create informative plots and charts
Visualize geographical data using Folium
Analyze trends and patterns in wildfire activities in Australia

# Dataset
- Time Frame: Data on fire activities in Australia starting from 2005.
- Regions: 7 distinct regions.
Variables:
- Date: UTC timestamp, with data for 24 hours ahead.
- Estimated Fire Area: Daily sum of estimated fire area (in kmÂ²) with > 75% confidence for each region.
- Mean Estimated Fire Brightness: Daily mean of fire brightness (in Kelvin) based on flagged fire pixels with > 75% confidence.
- Mean Estimated Fire Radiative Power: Daily mean radiative power (in megawatts) with > 75% confidence.
- Mean Confidence: Daily mean confidence level for fires with > 75% confidence.
- Std Confidence: Standard deviation of radiative power (in megawatts).
- Var Confidence: Variance of radiative power (in megawatts).
- Count: Daily number of pixels for fires with > 75% confidence.
- Replaced: Indicates if data has been replaced with higher-quality standard data (marked as 'Y' for replaced data, typically with a 2-3 month lag).

# Modifications and Enhancements
- Additional Data Visualizations: Added more comprehensive visualizations to provide deeper insights into the wildfire data.
- Enhanced Data Preprocessing: Improved data cleaning and preprocessing steps to ensure higher accuracy and reliability of the visualizations.
- Interactive Maps with Folium: Created interactive maps to visualize wildfire activities across different regions in Australia.
- Extended Analysis: Conducted further analysis to identify potential causes and patterns of wildfires.
